# Object_Localization_With_PyTorch


Object localization is a fundamental practical task in Computer Vision, which aims to locate the target within the image or video.


My project is about identifying the location of an object in an image by drawing a bounding box around it.
This project's model is based on a pretrained model 'EfficientNet_b0'
